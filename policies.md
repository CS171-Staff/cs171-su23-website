## Prerequisites

Since cryptography is fundamentally reliant on both math and programming, we require familiar with discrete mathematics (CS 70) and basic programming experience (CS 61A or CS 61B level). A class in algorithms (CS 170) and abstract algebra (Math 113) are helpful, but not required. No prior cryptography experience is assumed.

## Lecture

We will have live lecture on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursday from 6:30 PM to 8 PM in Evans 10. Lecture will also be webcasted and recorded via Zoom.

## Discussion Sections

There will be biweekly, **in-person** discussion sections led by a TA. These sections will help reinforce the material learned in lecture and provide strong foundations for homework and exams. **Discussion attendance is not required, and you can attend any section you wish.**

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held at scheduled times available on [the course calendar]({% link calendar.html %}). We will manage office hours by using an [online queue]({% link oh.md %}). Students (both in-person and online) can queue join the queue on this system. The queue system will notify the student when a TA has picked up their request.

All office hours will be held in a hybrid format, available to students requiring online instruction. In-person tickets will be prioritized.

## Readings

We may refer to textbook readings for further study, listed on the website (TBA).

## Exams

There will be one midterm exam and a final exam. Exams are mandatory and synchronous (everyone takes them at the same time). A remote exam will be offered to those with a valid reason (at the exact same time as the synchronous exam).

* The midterm is on **TBD**
* The final exam is on **TBD**

## Homeworks

There will be 8 homeworks, released weekly and due Sunday at midnight. These problem sets will cover the material for that week's lectures, and will be submitted to Gradescope. **We strongly recommend typesetting homework (e.g. in LaTeX), or at least having legible handwriting. Points will be deducted for poorly readable submissions.**

We will automatically drop your lowest homework score.

## Extension Policy

We understand that life is unpredictable, and want to work with you to make sure you are supported. While we do not provide slip days in this course, students may request an extension for any deadline by filling out [this form]({% link extensions.md %}).

## Grading

We will compute grades from a weighted average, as follows:

- Homeworks: 30%
- Midterm: 30%
- Final: 40%

The class as a whole is typically curved to the [department guidelines](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/faculty-staff/academic-personnel/grading-guidelines-undergrad) for upper-division CS classes.

## Ed

If you have a question, the best way to contact us is via [the course Ed site]({{ site.data.links.piazza }}). The staff (instructors and TAs) will check the site regularly.

If your question is personal or not of interest to other students, please mark the question as private.

## Collaboration Policy

We believe that most students can distinguish between helping other students understand course material and cheating. Explaining a subtle point from lecture or discussing course topics is an interaction that we encourage, but you must write your solutions strictly by yourself (with your partner on projects). You must not ask for homework/project solutions on Stack Overflow or other online sites; although you may ask for help with conceptual questions. You must not receive help on assignments from students who have taken the course in previous years, and you must not review homework or project solutions from previous years.

**Warning**: Your attention is drawn to the Department's Policy on Academic Dishonesty. In particular, you should be aware that copying or sharing solutions, in whole or in part, from other students in the class or any other source without acknowledgment constitutes cheating. Any student found to be cheating will (1) be referred to the Office of Student Conduct, (2) receive negative points on the assignment (i.e., worse than not doing it at all), and, depending on severity, (3) fail the course.
