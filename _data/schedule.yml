         ### Cryptography is the science of designing algorithms and protocols for enabling parties to communicate and compute securely in an untrusted environment (e.g. secure communication, digital signature and etc.) Over the last four decades, cryptography has transformed from an ad hoc collection of mysterious tricks into a rigorous science. This course will introduce students to the basic paradigms and principles of this rigorous science.
         ### Prerequisites: **CS 70 or equivalent**
# Events are items which appear in the schedule, but not necessarily on days
# where we have class. This is good for exams and assignment due dates.
#
# This hash is a list of events. Each event is an object with a description and
# a date. The description is parsed as Markdown. The date is used to decide
# where to insert the event. For neatness, you can keep the events sorted by
# date, although this is not necessary.
#
# These can still be used, but the latest format has mostly made them redundant.

# An agenda is a list of lectures. Each lecture can have the following elements:
#   readings: Title of lecture (with link to textbook). Appears in Readings column.
#   slides: Link to slides. Appears in Lectures column.
#   recording: Link to recording of lecture. Appears in Lectures column.
#   videos: Link to asynchronous videos. Appears in Lectures column.
#   nolecture: If "True", the Lectures column will display "No lecture." Useful for exams/holidays.
